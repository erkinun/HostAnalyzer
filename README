Host maximum capacity is assumed to be 100

Host input line errors are handled individually, if you have 10 hosts and 3 of them are not appropriate,
Analyzer will analyze 7 hosts.

You can create a distribution using "gradle distZip" command.
You can unzip the file, cd host_analyzer-1.0/bin and run ./host_analyzer FleetState.txt

Analyzer main method only accepts one argument, and that argument needs to be FleetState.txt
